# Introduction
With [regels.overheid.nl](https://open-regels.nl/) we are creating a public library that is accessible to everyone and that we are slowly but surely filling with legal analyses, rule specifications, software code and everything else that is needed and that can be used by public institutions. The intention is that it concerns open source software, and that therefore no property rights will accrue to anyone.

This filling is partly marketed in a public, transparent, equal and accessible manner for everyone. We want to provide access for all parties and/or persons who are interested in contributing to the renewal of the procurement market by the government in public-private partnerships (open-innovation coalition/community/ecosystem), while manoeuvring within existing legal frameworks. The agreements are always small-scale and have a short-cycle realization process (cf. agile, CI/CD for software realization).

We expect to expand this library with work packages that will find their way from other projects. Thus this isolated repository.

Ultimately, demand, supply and (partial) results of work packages will become searchable and findable via metadata.

Keep an eye on this library!
