# Introduction

## What is Doccle
Doccle is an online platform for receiving, handling and storing invoices and documents from a wide range of different companies. You can organise your administration, or that of several persons, centrally in one location.

Additionally you are able to administer your personal information on this very same platform. Once a company wants to obtain parts of your information, the company can make a consent request towards you, with the information they would like to obtain for a certain amount of time, and with which purpose so you can decide whether you want to accept this consent request or not.

For more information please go to: [https://doccle.nl/](https://doccle.nl/).

# Purpose

## Demonstrating Virtueel Inkomens Loket (VIL)
A citizen living in the municipality of Utrecht wants to know whether they are eligible for an allowance. The citizen is using Doccle to keep their information administered in one place.

### Process
1. This citizen logs into Doccle;
2. The citizen updates her/his information (i.e. their yearly income, marital status, age and such);
3. Doccle checks on the VIL rule set engine if the citizen is eligible for an allowance;
4. In case of a positive result, a form (in PDF) will be automatically generated with her/his allowance;
5. The citizen only needs to send out this form towards the municipality of Utrecht

### Video
This video demonstrates the process described above. It's in Dutch.
